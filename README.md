# WinStore
Winstore is a basic app-store like Steam or Microsoft store. 
The problem with those two is that Steam for example only has games and Microsoft store only has a very limited variety of apps.
This app should change all that. I will manually add all apps with their dedicated links to it. 
It is also all connected trough a database so you don't need to worry about getting out of date content.

The app is written entirely in Python

## Updates:
- As of now the app has not been compiled to an exe
- The app has not been colored or properly tested
- All functions should be functional
- App is connected to the database
- App requires internet!
